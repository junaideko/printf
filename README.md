_printf()                                                            
                                                                    

The project involves creating a _printf function that works like the 
standard c library printf function.                                  

                                                                     
And was created by Junaid-eko Raimot and Abilawon Adeola.            
                                                                     
_printf performatted output conversion and prints data to the standar
d output just like the standard c printf .                           

                                                                     
This version of printf also accept some format specifiers such as %c
 %s, %d, %% and %i.                                                  
                                                                     

The prototypes used for writing this function is int _printf(const ch
ar *format, ...);                                                    

                                                                    
This prototype is is cariadic funtion type. it can receives certain n
umbers of arguments passed into the formated string.                 

                                                                     for more details see man 3 printf.
